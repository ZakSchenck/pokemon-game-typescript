## Project Description
Completely inspired by pokemon battle systems. You can attack, with each attack having different damage and miss properties. After attacking, the computer will use a random attack with different properties from the player's attacks. Character wins when the health bar reaches zero. This project has some heavy DOM manipulation and fairly complex logic.

## Project Hurtles
The biggest issue for me was working with ``setInterval``, ``clearInterval``, and ``setTimeout``. This was for the auto reading text when the player attacks, along with the computer following. Combining the interval attack logic with the logic behind whether a character wins or not was a bit tricky. Here's my code for this section.

```js
setInterval((): void => {
  healthColor(playerOneHealth, playerOneHealthBar);
}, 500);
// Setting interval for the game state auto reading text
const intervalFunction = () => {
  healthColor(playerTwoHealth, playerTwoHealthBar);
  const interval = setInterval(() => {
    gameStateText.style.display = "block";
    attackContainer.style.display = "none";
  }, 1);
  const intervalTwo = setInterval(() => {
    playerTwoAttack();
    clearInterval(intervalTwo);
  }, 2502);
  setTimeout(() => {
    clearInterval(interval);
    if (playerOneHealth >= 0) {
      gameStateText.style.display = "none";
      attackContainer.style.display = "grid";
    }
  }, 5004);
};
```
